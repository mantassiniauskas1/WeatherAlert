This is a Ruby on Rails Weather Alert app that I created for a company's interview assignment.

It takes GPS information of a driver, located in USA, as an input, gets the state via Geocoder API, gets severe or higher weather conditions that day via api.weather.gov and sends an email alerting the drivers every morning.
